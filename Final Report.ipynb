    "- The Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_California) was scraped using the BeautifulSoup library to build a pandas dataframe listing the buroughs and neighborhoods in Los Angeles. The dataframe was cleaned and processed appropriately.\n",
    "- Current Houses Prices\n",
    "- Houses Prices from 5 years earlier\n",
    "- Houses Prices from 25 years earlier\n",
    "- The Foursquare API was then used to query each of the neighborhood for the keywords {real estate, residential} and {hotel, hostel, motel}. The resulting locations for each venue were tabulated and stored in a new dataframe and visualised using Folium.\n",
    "- A better visualisation was performed by obtaining the cluster centers for each group of laundromat and hotel. The cluster centers were plotted on a Folium map, with the circle marker weighted corresponding to the number of venues in the specific cluster."

    "- You can invest in either income-producing properties or non-income-producing properties. Any leased property is income producing, and vacant properties are non-income producing. You can still earn a capital return on a non-income producing property, just as you would on an investment in a home.   \n",
    "- Buying real estate requires substantial due diligence to ensure that you're getting what you expect after you close."
